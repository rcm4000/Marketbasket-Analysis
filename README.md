# Marketbasket-Analysis

Introduction:

The purpose of the project is to create a program that will discover interesting relations among variables in a dataset, using the association rule and Apriori Algorithm.

Programming Language:
Python, using Pandas 

Program:
Anaconda’s Jupyter Notebook

Project Details:

For this project I created 5 databases with 20 transactions that contains items that can be seen in Shop-Rite, Guitar Center, Macy’s, Micro-Center and The Home Depot.  Customers normally purchase these items and the order number and item number are normally saved in the Orders tables.  For the purpose of this project I am going to extract from the database the order number and the item type.    For example, if someone orders ‘Horizon Milk’, I will have the category ‘Milk’ for the item, instead of the brand.  In addition, the column headers were excluded from the extract files.

I am going to save the order numbers and items as a list in a comma delimited file and use python (jupytor Notebook) to find the association rule using Apriori Algorithm.
